# 🧪 The Flavor Lab MVP: Flavor Pairing via Graph Embeddings

**The Flavor Lab** is a demonstration of a scientific, chemistry-backed recommendation system designed to generate surprising yet delicious flavor pairings.

Implements a **Similarity Search Model** based on the conceptual output of a **Graph Embeddings Model**

## 🧠 AI Model: Graph Embeddings Simulation

The core of this application simulates the prediction step of a Graph Embeddings Model:

1.  **Model Training (Simulated):** The application uses pre-defined vectors (`INGREDIENT_VECTORS` in `app.py`). In a full project, these vectors would be the low-dimensional mathematical representations of ingredients generated by training a Graph Embedding Model on the **FlavorGraph** database.
2.  **Prediction Logic:** The `get_pairings` function calculates the **Cosine Similarity** between the input ingredient's vector and every other vector.
3.  **Output:** Ranks the results by the resulting similarity score, providing scientifically backed pairings. Ingredients that are mathematically "closer" in the vector space share more aromatic compounds, leading to surprising and excellent pairings.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Deployment

* **Model Type:** Graph Embeddings / Similarity Search
* **Web Framework:** Gradio 
* **Core Libraries:** `numpy`, `pandas`
* **Deployment:** Hugging Face Spaces (via Gradio SDK)

## ✨ MVP Features

* **Input:** User selects a base ingredient.
* **Output:** Generates the top 5 mathematically similar flavor pairings.
